Libraries Used: alsaaudio, python-dev

Purpose/Idea: To be able to be over by my kitchen sink and yell at my webcam usb microphone to turn on some Fleet Foxes,
since I can't be bothered to go over and do it myself.


Steps to execute plan:

1.Figure out how to grab audio from webcam with python.  DONE!
2.Figure out how to output audio with python.   DONE!
3.Figure out how to parse audio files into regular expressions/commands. In progress
  3a.how to parse out command to open mp3 player?
  3b.how to parse out command to open given artist?

4.Figure out how to open any mp3 player with python given a command.

(optional):figure out how to make a graphical interface?


This is my new project, but if any one wants to help out I'd be pretty excited.  I'm developing this for Debian based
Linux and then maybe adding other OS support later (much later).
